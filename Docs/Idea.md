#Idea
->Train a chatbot to answer questions based on the already existing Q&A dataset.  

#approach
->Decide the ML technique to use (Say Neural Net/SVM...)  
->Find datasets sources to train the chatbot  
->Test the chatbot  


#Update  
->I think a crude version of this can be done without any AI/ML approach. Example : Just find the similarity(say Jaccard or Cosine) between questions and display the answer
